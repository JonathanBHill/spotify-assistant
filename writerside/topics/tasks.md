# Spotify Assistant Improvement Tasks

This document contains a detailed checklist of actionable improvement tasks for the Spotify Assistant project. Tasks are organized by category and logically ordered for implementation.

## Architecture Improvements

1. [ ] Resolve circular dependency between spotify-assistant-core and spotify-assistant-database
   - Consider creating a shared library for common models and interfaces

   - [ ] Define clear boundaries between UI, business logic, and data access layers
   - [ ] Ensure unidirectional dependencies between layers

3. [ ] Standardize error handling across the codebase
   - [ ] Create a unified error type system in the core crate
   - [ ] Replace panic! calls with proper error propagation

4. [ ] Implement configuration management
   - [ ] Create a centralized configuration system
   - [ ] Move hardcoded values (like database paths) to configuration

5. [ ] Implement proper dependency injection
   - [ ] Use trait objects for dependencies
   - [ ] Create a service registry or dependency container

## Code Organization and Quality

6. [ ] Complete implementation of empty crates
   - [ ] Add dependencies and implementation for spotify-assistant-cli
