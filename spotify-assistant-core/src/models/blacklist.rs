    /// 3. Prepares a vector of artist names for display, inserting a "Cancel" option at the top.
    /// 4. Presents a selection menu to the user via the `dialoguer::Select` interface, allowing them to
    ///    choose an artist to remove or cancel the operation.
    /// 5. If the "Cancel" option is chosen, no action is taken, and a message is printed.
    /// 6. If an artist is selected, the corresponding artist is removed from the blacklist by calling
    ///    the `remove_artist` method.
    ///
    /// # Behavior:
    /// - The "Cancel" option is always the first item in the list, with index 0.
    /// - If the "Cancel" option is selected, no modification is made to the blacklist, and a confirmation
    ///   message is displayed.
    /// - If a valid artist is selected, the method removes the artist from the blacklist using the artist's
    ///   name and ID and calls `self.remove_artist()`.
    ///
    /// # Example:
    /// ```rust
    /// // Imagine `self` is an instance of the relevant struct that contains this method.
    /// // Calling this method will show a terminal menu for selecting an artist to remove:
    /// use spotify_assistant_core::models::blacklist::Blacklist;
    /// let mut blacklist = Blacklist::default();
    /// blacklist.select_artist_to_remove();
    /// // The user selects an artist, and the selected artist is removed from the blacklist.
    /// ```
    ///
    /// # Dependencies:
    /// - `dialoguer::Select` is used to present the selection menu in the terminal.
    /// - The `BlacklistArtist` struct is expected to provide `name()` and `id()` methods.
    ///
    /// # Note:
    /// - This method assumes the `artists()` method exists in `self` and returns an iterable collection of
    ///   `BlacklistArtist` objects.
    /// - The `remove_artist()` method is called internally with the selected artist's name and ID to complete
    ///   the removal process.
    ///
    /// # Errors:
    /// The method does not explicitly handle errors thrown by `dialoguer::Select`.
    /// If an error occurs (e.g., terminal input/output failure), it will panic.

    /// A method for selecting an artist to add to a blacklist by iterating through a map of albums and their associated artists.
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    /// - `artists_with_album`: A `HashMap` where the key is a `String` representing the album name, and the value is a `Vec` of `SimplifiedArtist` objects representing the artists associated with the album.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// Returns an `Option<BlacklistArtist>`:
    /// - `Some(BlacklistArtist)` if an artist is selected.
    /// - `None` if no artist is selected (e.g., user cancels the selection).
    ///
    /// # Behavior
    /// 1. The method receives a `HashMap` of artists grouped by album.
    /// 2. An interactive CLI-based menu is displayed allowing the user to select an artist or cancel the selection.
    ///    - Each artist is labeled with a formatted string that includes the index, artist name, artist ID, and album name.
    ///    - "Cancel" is presented as the first option in the selection list.
    /// 3. If the user selects an artist:
    ///    - Extracts and parses the selected artist's details (`name` and `id`) from the menu using string splitting.
    ///    - Constructs a `BlacklistArtist` object with the parsed details.
    /// 4. If "Cancel" is selected (index 0 in the selection menu):
    ///    - A message is printed indicating that no artist was selected.
    ///    - Returns `None`.
    /// 5. If an artist is successfully selected, returns a `BlacklistArtist` object with the selected details.
    ///
    /// # Panics
    /// - Panics if the `artist.id` for any artist in the map is `None`.
    /// - Panics if the interaction with the user fails during the selection process.
    ///
    /// # Notes
    /// - This method is interactive and depends on the `dialoguer` crate for user input handling.
    /// - Ensure the `artists_with_album` contains valid artist data with non-`None` IDs to avoid panics.
