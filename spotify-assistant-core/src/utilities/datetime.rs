/// A structure representing checks related to the current date and time.
///
/// The `Checks` struct stores information about the current date, day of the week,
/// and a specific time of day for use in applications where such checks are necessary.
///
/// # Fields
///
/// * `now` - The current date and time with timezone information.
///   It is represented as a `DateTime<Local>` to handle local time.
/// * `day_of_week` - The current day of the week.
///   This is represented using the `Weekday` enum, which provides variants for each day (e.g., Monday, Tuesday).
/// * `time_of_day` - A representation of a specific time of day.
///   This is typically used to store details like hours, minutes, or seconds
///   and is encapsulated in the `TimeOfDay` struct or equivalent.
///
/// # Usage
/// This structure can be utilized for tasks like scheduling, validations,
/// or any functionality that depends on the current date or time-related attributes in a local timezone.

    /// Checks if a given date string is outdated based on a threshold duration.

    /// # Parameters
    /// - `input`: A string slice representing the input date to check. Expected formats are `%m-%d-%Y` or `%Y-%m-%d`.
    /// - `threshold`: A `Duration` representing the cutoff threshold. The date in `input` is compared to the current
    ///   date minus this threshold to determine if it is outdated.

    /// # Returns
    /// - `true` if the `input` date is earlier than the computed cutoff date based on the threshold.
    /// - `false` otherwise.
    ///
    /// # Behavior
    /// - The method attempts to parse the input date against predefined formats (`%m-%d-%Y`, `%Y-%m-%d`).
    /// - If no matching format is found, the first format (`%m-%d-%Y`) is used as a fallback.
    /// - The parsed `input` date is compared with the cutoff date (i.e., `self.now.date_naive() - threshold`).
    /// - Extensive debugging information is logged for tracing the computation process.
    ///
    /// # Panics
    /// - This function uses `unwrap_or_default` for parsing the date. If the fallback value of `NaiveDate` (i.e., `NaiveDate::default()`)
    ///   is not suitable for the intended logic, adjust the handling of invalid input dates.
    ///
    /// # Example
    /// ```
    /// use chrono::Duration; // Make sure to include the chrono crate
    /// use spotify_assistant_core::utilities::datetime::Checks;
    ///
    /// let checker = Checks::default();
