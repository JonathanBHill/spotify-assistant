    /// - `number_of_loops`: The number of iterations (or pages) to fetch and extend the play history.
    ///
    /// # Behavior
    /// - This asynchronous function fetches additional pages of play history based on the specified `number_of_loops`.
    /// - For each iteration:
    ///     - It uses the `self.next()` method to fetch the next page of play history data.
    ///     - The `items` from the fetched `next_page` are reversed and converted to a `Vec<PlayHistory>`.
    ///     - The reversed items are then extended into `self.tracks`.
    ///     - The `self.next` field is updated to point to the next page URL if provided, or an empty string if no further page exists.
    ///
    /// # Requirements
    /// - The `self.next()` method must return future-like objects that resolve into a structure containing the `items` and `next` URL for the next page.
    ///
    /// # Caveats
    /// - If `next_page.next` is `None` (indicating the end of the history), `self.next` is updated to an empty string, effectively terminating further loops early.
    ///
    /// # Usage
    /// Call this method when you want to extend the current play history with more records.
    ///

    /// ```rust

    /// async fn main() {
    ///     let mut user_history = UserListeningHistory::new().await;
