/// The `Editor` struct is used to manage and handle Spotify playlists, serving as a utility

///
/// # Fields
///
/// - `client` (`AuthCodeSpotify`):
///   An authenticated Spotify client used to make API calls and manage playlist operations.
///
/// - `ref_id` (`PlaylistId<'static>`):
///   The ID of the reference playlist. Typically serves as the source or "template" playlist
///   for comparison or duplication purposes.
///
/// - `target_id` (`PlaylistId<'static>`):
///   The ID of the target playlist. Represents the playlist that will be updated, cloned, or manipulated
///   based on the operations applied.
///
/// - `ref_pl` (`FullPlaylist`):
///   Holds the full details of the reference playlist, including its metadata, tracks, and other information.
///   This structure provides a detailed snapshot of the source playlist for playlist operations.
///
/// - `target_pl` (`FullPlaylist`):
///   Contains the full details of the target playlist, including its metadata, tracks, and other information.
///   This allows for interacting with and updating the target playlist as needed.
///
/// # Purpose
///
/// The `Editor` struct is designed to facilitate complex playlist operations, such as:
/// - Comparing playlists (e.g., finding differences or similarities between two playlists).
/// - Duplicating playlists or replicating tracks from one playlist into another.
/// - Synchronizing or updating playlists based on another playlist's content.
///
/// The struct leverages Spotify's API capabilities through the provided `client` to ensure
/// efficient and authenticated interaction with playlists.

    /// ## Process Overview:
    /// 1. Creates a `PlaylistXplr` instance and identifies "liked" songs within the target playlist.
    /// 2. Transforms the liked songs into a list of `PlayableId` instances.
    /// 3. Iteratively removes the liked songs from the playlist in chunks of 100 items per batch,
    ///    updating the playlist snapshot after each successful batch process.
    ///
    /// ## Logging:
    /// - DEBUG: Logs detailed information, such as the count of liked songs and real-time progress status.
    /// - INFO: Provides updates when liked songs are successfully removed and when playlist data is refreshed.
    /// - ERROR: Captures any errors encountered during the removal or playlist fetching operations.
    ///
    /// ## Error Handling:
    /// - Panics if a track lacks a unique ID or if the target playlist cannot be refreshed.
    /// - Panics if the API call to remove songs fails for any reason.
    ///
    /// ## Snapshot:
    /// Keeps track of the playlist's snapshot ID to ensure that changes are applied consistently
    /// and to avoid potential conflicts from concurrent playlist updates.
    ///
    /// ## Batching:
    /// - Processes liked songs in chunks of 100 to comply with API restrictions and manage network resources.
    ///
    /// ## Example Usage:
    /// ```
    /// use spotify_assistant_core::actions::update::Editor;
    /// use spotify_assistant_core::enums::pl::PlaylistType;
    ///
    /// async fn main() {
    ///     let mut editor = Editor::new(PlaylistType::StockRR.get_id(), PlaylistType::MyRR.get_id()).await;
    ///     editor.remove_liked_songs().await;
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Prerequisites:
    /// Ensure that `self.client` is a valid Spotify client and that `self.target_id`
    /// refers to an existing playlist with valid permissions for modification.
    ///
    /// ## Panics:
    /// - If a track lacks an ID.
    /// - If there is a failure in refreshing the target playlist.
    /// - If any batch removal API call fails.
    ///
    /// ## Dependencies:
    /// - `playlist_remove_all_occurrences_of_items`: API endpoint to remove tracks.
    /// - `playlist`: API call to refresh the playlist metadata.
    ///
    /// ## Notes:
    /// - Make sure that large playlist modifications are logged appropriately to trace actions during execution.
    /// - This function assumes that the user has adequate permission to modify the specified playlist.

    /// Asynchronously retrieves a list of unique track IDs from album references.
    ///
    /// # Description
    /// This method fetches track IDs associated with the albums referenced within the instance.
    /// It performs the following workflow:
    /// 1. Fetches album IDs by calling an internal asynchronous method `get_reference_track_album_ids_filtered`.
    /// 2. Splits the album IDs into manageable chunks (of size 20) for processing to comply with potential API constraints.
    /// 3. For each chunk of album IDs, retrieves the album details (including track information) using the client.
    /// 4. Extracts track IDs from the retrieved albums, ensuring all IDs are unique by maintaining a deduplicated vector.
    /// 5. Prints the size of the return vector and the cleaned track ID vector for debugging purposes.
    ///
    /// The function ultimately returns a deduplicated vector of track IDs.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// - `Vec<TrackId>`: A vector containing unique track IDs associated with the referenced albums.
    ///
    /// # Panics
    /// - The function will panic if:
    ///   - Retrieving albums from album IDs fails.
    ///   - Cloning track IDs fails.
    ///
    /// # Notes
    /// - This function uses an internal helper method `Self::append_uniques` to append unique track IDs to the result vector.
    /// - Another internal helper method `Self::clean_duplicate_id_vector` is used to remove any duplicate track IDs inadvertently introduced.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    /// ```rust
    /// use spotify_assistant_core::actions::update::Editor;
    /// use spotify_assistant_core::enums::pl::PlaylistType;
    ///
    /// async fn main() {

    /// - `crate::tracing`: Used for logging and tracing the flow of execution for debugging purposes.
