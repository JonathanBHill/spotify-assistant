///
/// * `client` - An instance of `AuthCodeSpotify` which is the authenticated Spotify client
///   used to communicate with the Spotify Web API. This client holds the required
///   authorization details for API access.
///
/// * `album_id` - The unique identifier (`AlbumId`) for the album being explored. This helps
///   identify the album in the Spotify catalog.
///
/// * `full_album` - A `FullAlbum` struct that contains all the detailed information
///   about the album, such as its title, artist(s), tracks, release date,
///   and other metadata.
