///
/// * `client` (`AuthCodeSpotify`): An authenticated Spotify client used to access and
///   manage Spotify API resources. Requires proper authentication credentials for operation.
///
/// * `playlist_id` (`PlaylistId<'static>`): The unique identifier for the Spotify playlist
///   that the struct refers to. This ID is used to query and perform actions on the playlist
///   through the Spotify API.
///
/// * `full_playlist` (`FullPlaylist`): A complete representation of the playlist, including
///   metadata, owner details, and any other associated information fetched from Spotify.
///
/// * `tracks` (`Vec<FullTrack>`): A vector containing detailed information about each track
///   in the playlist. Each element provides metadata about a single track, such as its
///   name, artist, album, and duration.
///
/// * `duplicates` (`bool`): A private field (not accessible outside this struct) that
///   indicates whether the playlist contains duplicate tracks. This can be used internally
///   for operations such as filtering or alerting the user of duplicate entries.

    /// - Uses [tracing](https://docs.rs/tracing) for structured logging at various log levels:
    ///   - `INFO`: Marks the entry into the function.
    ///   - `DEBUG`: Logs details about batch processing and sizes of track collections.
    ///   - `ERROR`: Logs any errors encountered during API calls.

    ///   and panics.

    /// This function will panic if it encounters an error while fetching track metadata
    /// from the Spotify API. Ensure proper error handling mechanisms are implemented
    /// in higher-level logic to handle such cases resiliently.
    ///
    /// # Usage Example
    /// ```no_run ignore
    /// use spotify_api_library::FullTrack; // Replace with actual FullTrack import

    /// Asynchronously retrieves and maps artists associated with albums in the context of the `ExplorePlaylist` object.

    /// 2. Extracts artist information for each album and filters out any duplicate artists if the `duplicates` flag is set to `false`.
    /// 3. Aggregates the list of unique artists for each album into a `HashMap` where the key is the album name
    ///    (a `String`), and the value is a `Vec` of the artists (represented as `SimplifiedArtist`).

    /// The method includes logging at various trace levels to track progress and potential issues:
    /// - Logs the current album chunk being processed at the `DEBUG` level.
    /// - Logs any errors encountered when retrieving albums at the `ERROR` level.
    /// - Logs detailed debugging information related to the lengths of raw and cleaned artist lists.

    /// A `HashMap` where:
    /// - The keys are album names (`String`).
    /// - The values are vectors of `SimplifiedArtist` objects representing the unique artists associated with the album.

    /// This function may panic under the following conditions:
    /// - If an album retrieval request fails (e.g., due to a network error), a panic is triggered with the error message.
    /// - If a `SimplifiedArtist` instance lacks an `id`, a panic is triggered as the artist ID is critical for filtering duplicates.
    ///
    /// # Considerations
    /// - The method processes album chunks in sizes of 20 to comply with API limitations or optimize batch processing.
    /// - Filtering for duplicate artists is controlled by the `duplicates` flag in the `ExplorePlaylist` struct.
    ///   When this flag is `false`, duplicate artist IDs are cleaned out.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    /// Although not returned explicitly as a `Result`, errors related to API calls and data retrieval are logged
    /// and would result in a panic, halting further execution.
    ///
    /// # Example Usage
    /// ```no_run ignore
    /// async fn example(playlist: &PlaylistXplr) {
    ///     let artists_map = playlist.artists_by_album().await;

    ///             println!(" - Artist: {}", artist.name);
    ///         }
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// # Dependencies
    /// The method depends on the following:
    /// - `tokio` or another async runtime for asynchronous execution.
    /// - A `self.client` field that provides an API interface for fetching album details.
    /// - A `SimplifiedArtist` and `FullAlbum` type representing artist and album information retrieved from the API.
    /// - A logging framework compatible with `tracing` for structured logging and instrumentation.
    ///
    /// # Notes
    /// - Ensure the `self.album_ids()` method exists and correctly provides the IDs of albums that need processing.
    /// - Verify that the client used in `self.client.albums` is configured properly, including its market and proper handling of API rate limits.
