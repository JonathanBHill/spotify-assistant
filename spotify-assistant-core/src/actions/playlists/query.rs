    ///
    /// 1. The function builds a regex pattern from the `playlist_name` to match potential playlists.
    /// 2. Searches for playlists using the Spotify API with a maximum of 50 results.
    /// 3. Filters the search results to find playlists with names matching the regex pattern.

    /// 6. Prints information about the selected playlist, such as its name and owner.
    ///
    /// # Error Handling
    ///
    /// - If the search result doesn't match the expected `SearchResult::Playlists` variant, a default playlist is returned.
    /// - Any unwrapping failures for Spotify API interactions will result in a runtime panic.
    /// - If regex creation fails, it will also result in a runtime panic.
    /// - The code currently does not gracefully handle user interaction errors with the playlist selection.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// use spotify_assistant_core::actions::playlists::query::PlaylistQuery;
    /// async fn main() {
    ///     let client = PlaylistQuery::new().await;
    ///     let playlist_name = "Chill Vibes".to_string();

    ///         }
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// # Dependencies
    ///
    /// - `regex` crate is used for building and matching the playlist name.
    /// - `dialoguer` crate is used for user interaction to select the desired playlist.
    /// - Spotify API client must be properly configured to use this functionality.
    ///
    /// # Notes
    ///
    /// - Ensure the Spotify API credentials are configured and have the appropriate permissions to search public playlists.
    /// - The function currently uses `unwrap()` extensively, which can lead to panics in case of errors. Consider improving error handling.
    ///
    /// # Panics
    ///
    /// The function may panic under the following conditions:
    /// - Failure to create the regex pattern.
    /// - Any `unwrap()` failure when handling results from the Spotify client API, interaction dialogs, or regex matching.
