    /// 1. Loads environment variables using the `dotenv` crate.
    /// 2. Sets up an asynchronous Spotify client with the required scopes using the `set_up_client` method.
    /// 3. Extracts the tracks from the given playlist and processes them into a collection of `FullTrack` items.

    ///    - If the item is a `PlayableItem` of type `Episode`, or if the item is `None`, the function logs an error and terminates the process with a panic.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    /// - `playlist`: A `FullPlaylist` object containing the complete playlist information, including its tracks.
