/// Enum `PlaylistType`
///
/// This enumeration represents different types of playlists available within the application. Each variant specifies a unique 
/// type of playlist, which may have different characteristics, data, or purposes. These playlist types are predefined as follows:
///
/// Variants:
/// - `StockRR`: Represents a stock playlist with round-robin functionality. Typically used for default or system-generated playlists.
/// - `MyRR`: Represents a user-defined playlist with round-robin functionality.
/// - `Top24`: Refers to a specific top playlist for the year 24. This could represent a curated or most popular selection for that year.
/// - `Top23`: Represents the top playlist for the year 23.
/// - `Top22`: Represents the top playlist for the year 22.
/// - `Top21`: Represents the top playlist for the year 21.
/// - `Top20`: Represents the top playlist for the year 20.
/// - `Top19`: Represents the top playlist for the year 19.
/// - `Top18`: Represents the top playlist for the year 18.
///
/// Usage of this enum allows for clear categorization and handling of playlists across the application.

    /// 1. It attempts to load environment configurations from a `.env` file located at
    ///    `ProjectFiles::DotEnv.path()`. 
    ///    - If the file cannot be found or there is an issue, the function continues execution.
    /// 2. Depending on the `PlaylistType` variant, it selects the appropriate environment variable name:
    ///    - `PlaylistType::StockRR` -> `"RELEASE_RADAR_ID"`
    ///    - `PlaylistType::MyRR` -> `"MY_RELEASE_RADAR_ID"`
    ///    - `PlaylistType::Top24` -> `"TOP_24_ID"`
    ///    - `PlaylistType::Top23` -> `"TOP_23_ID"`
    ///    - `PlaylistType::Top22` -> `"TOP_22_ID"`
    ///    - `PlaylistType::Top21` -> `"TOP_21_ID"`
    ///    - `PlaylistType::Top20` -> `"TOP_20_ID"`
    ///    - `PlaylistType::Top19` -> `"TOP_19_ID"`
    ///    - `PlaylistType::Top18` -> `"TOP_18_ID"`
    /// 3. It retrieves the value of the selected environment variable using `std::env::var`.
    ///    - If the environment variable is not found, the function panics with the error message:
    ///      `"Error: The MY_RELEASE_RADAR_ID environmental variable was not found".`
    /// 4. It creates a `PlaylistId` from this retrieved ID using `PlaylistId::from_id(Cow::from(rr_id))`.
    ///    - If the creation fails, it panics with the error message:
    ///      `"Error: The PlaylistId could not be created from the playlists ID".`
    /// 5. Converts the resulting `PlaylistId` into a static version using `into_static()` and returns it.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// A `'static` `PlaylistId` representing the playlist corresponding to the current `PlaylistType`
    /// variant.
    ///
    /// # Panics
    ///
    /// - If the required environment variable for the specified `PlaylistType` is not found, 
    ///   the function will panic with a clear error message.
    /// - If a `PlaylistId` cannot be created from the retrieved playlist ID, the function will panic
    ///   with a descriptive error message.
